## 🎯 Description

**Functional Texas Hold’em** is a command-line poker game built in **OCaml**. Players compete in turn-based rounds against simulated bot opponents with simple strategies based on hand strength. The game handles all core poker mechanics, including:

- Card dealing  
- Hand evaluation  
- Turn-based betting  
- Winner determination  

Built as part of a larger effort to explore **functional programming**, this project emphasizes clean architecture, immutability, and modular design using OCaml.

## 🛠 Features

- Terminal-based user interface with clear prompts and game flow  
- AI-controlled opponents with basic probabilistic decision-making  
- Modular OCaml architecture for maintainability and testing  
- 80%+ test coverage using **OUnit** for game logic and functionality

## 🚀 How to Run

> No installation necessary beyond OCaml and dune.

Clone the repo and run the game using dune:

```bash
dune exec bin/main.exe
```
