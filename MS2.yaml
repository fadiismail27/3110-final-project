  Our project is a terminal-based Texas Holdâ€™em Poker game built in OCaml.
  Players are dealt cards and compete in turn-based rounds against simulated
  opponents. The game supports basic poker logic including card dealing,
  hand evaluation, and winner determination. Opponents behave using simple
  randomized strategies based on hand strength, creating a believable game
  experience. Designed with modular OCaml architecture and a clean terminal
  UI, the game is both a fun challenge and a demonstration of functional
  programming principles.
